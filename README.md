# L-System-Weather-Vis
A weather visualizer that uses data for the next week to make a space filling curve.

Using L systems I took weather API and visualized the cloud coverage for each our of the upcoming week. Each dot in the space filling curve is one hour.
The color of each dot represents the percentage of cloud coverage on that hour. black is full cloud coverage, and bright yellow is no clouds. 

The red dot indicates a repetition of the 168 hours in the week.

Using help from the p5.js documentation on L-systems and Open Meteo Weather API
